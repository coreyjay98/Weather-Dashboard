# Weather Dashboard

## Brief

This project I was assigned the task of creating a wather dashboard that used ajax calls from API's to gater information about weather and display that to the user when they searched for their city of choice. I had to create a simplistic UI that was easy to use and provide correct and accurate information about the weather for the user.

### Review

For me this project started out easier than many of the projects I have completed before as I felt like I have acquired a good understanding of ajax and so being able to navigate through the data felt quite comfortable to me. I began to struggle once I had created the display and needed to save and recall the search history. To combat my problem I used arrays to store the previous search and was able to create a button that displayed the previous search if the user needed to revisit. This proved to be a successful progression for me as I ran into a problem as was able to overcome it through the power of Java!
