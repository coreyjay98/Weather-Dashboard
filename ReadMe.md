# Weather Dashboard

This project is currently a work in progress and I have not yet fully completed to the standard I need it to be, I will continue to work on it and hopefully get it in working order as soon as i can.

## Brief

This project I was assigned the task of creating a wather dashboard that used ajax calls from API's to gater information about weather and display that to the user when they searched for their city of choice. I had to create a simplistic UI that was easy to use and provide correct and accurate information about the weather for the user.

### Review

For me this project started out easier than many of the projects I have completed before as I felt like I have acquired a good understanding of ajax and so being able to navigate through the data felt quite comfortable to me. I began to struggle once I had created the display and needed to save and recall the search history. To combat my problem I used arrays to store the previous search and was able to create a button that displayed the previous search if the user needed to revisit. This proved to be a successful progression for me as I ran into a problem as was able to overcome it through the power of Java!

This was just an example of some of the troubles that I faced in this task and so this task served as a constant learning experience for me as progressed through, the knowledge I now have of the ajax feature will help me in the future and I know that I will be comfortable using this feature again.
